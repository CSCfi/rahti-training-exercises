* Back in the deployment page, use the "Add storage" page to mount the volume you just created to the `/static` folder.

* Use the web interface terminal to down load a JPG photo to the volume. (There are other ways to upload data to a volume, but that is a topic for another time)

* Go back to the application and check if you can see the photo you downloaded.

* Delete the running Pod, wait till it is recreated. If you reload the page that shows the photos, it should be still be displayed.
