<h1>Explore python application</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre-requisites, the application created in <em><a href="/exercises/A02/index.html">Exercise 2</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this exercise we will use the web interface to explore the application created in the previous step and get some data about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check the overview page in the web interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many Pods are running?</li>
<li>Which ports are exposed for internal traffic?</li>
<li>Which URL is exposed for external traffic?</li>
<li>How much memory is being used? What about the CPU and network?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to see the logs of the build, and check what was done. Which python packages were installed?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Overview" src="img/overview.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>From the web interface, open a terminal to the running application and run few commands:<ul>
<li><code>ps x</code></li>
<li><code>cat /etc/os-release</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="terminal" src="img/terminal.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Check the application logs, what information can you see? Can you see the log entry of the visit you made in the previous exercise?</li>
</ul>
