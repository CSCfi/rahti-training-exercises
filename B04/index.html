<h1>Create Service and Route</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre-requisites, the Pod created in <em><a href="/exercises/B03/index.html">Exercise 3</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this exercise we will make the pod accessible to the whole Internet, using a HTTPS URL.</p>
<h2>Create a Service</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the 'Application console', create a service called <a href="/exercises/B04/hello-service.yaml">hello-service</a> that load balances the Pod from exercise 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the 'Application console':</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the selector is <code>app=hello-pod</code></li>
<li>Check the IP of the service (it should begin by <code>172</code>)</li>
<li>Check the list of Pods, you should see the Pod created in Exercise 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong>: Try to understand what is what links this Service with this Pod.</p>
<h2>Create a Route</h2>
<ul>
<li>From the Application console, create a Route using the form. User the Service create in the previous step (Should be only available anyway), make the route secure (HTTPS), and let Rahti choose the Host-name URL.<ul>
<li>Check which host-name URL was auto generated and using the browser, go to that URL.</li>
<li>Go back to the Pod's log and see if your visit has been logged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
