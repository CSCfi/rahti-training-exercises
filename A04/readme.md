# Modify python application

> Pre-requisites, the application created in [Exercise 2](/exercises/A02/index.html)

In this exercise we will change the background colour of the application pages, from silver to beige (or any other colour you may like better).

* First edit the file `app.py` of your fork of the repository. Change the word silver to beige in the CSS.

* Secondly, launch a new build.

* Watch from the overview page how the process goes.

* When done, go back to the application and see the result.

**Note**: In Exercise block C, there is an exercise to automatize this process.
