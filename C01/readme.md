# Temporary storage

> Pre-requisites, the application created in *[Exercise 2](/exercises/A02/index.html)*

In this exercise we will add temporary storage to the application and see how it behaves.

* Add an empty dir and mount it in `/cache`.

* Copy a file to `/cache` in the Pod

* Delete the Pod and check that the file is gone from the new Pod.

* From a terminal, check with the command `df`, how much space is available in the `/cache` folder.
